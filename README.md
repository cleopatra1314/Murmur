## About
How do you get to know a place? Through Google? From travel books? Or by immersing yourself in that location, experiencing it firsthand, and interacting with the local people?</br>
Murmur Wall is an iOS app which brings you a new way to explore the places and enhance connection with the surroundings environment.</br>
You can post the murmurs on map as like you leave messages on the graffiti wall and see what others have posts on your region as well. Besides, you're able to chat with users nearby and have chance to meet with each other.</br>

### Features
- Share posts which stick on your current location.
- Say anything you feel about the place and post it.
- Chat with other users, every chatroom will disappear in 72 hrs.
- Change profile picture, murmur status and check what you have posted 

### Highlights
- Imported MapKit, CoreLocation to detect and update coordinate of different users and generate posts on Apple map.
- Periodically updated the locations of all users to optimize the efficiency of the app.  
- Instantly determine users' online or offline status by leveraging NotificationCenter to observe their movement between entering the background or foreground. 
- Developed custom camera and related features via AVFoundation.
- Built dynamic real-time chatroom by Firebase listener with flexible, expanded data structure to effectively save network usage. 

### Skills
- Used Firebase to store data when creating a plan.
- Used Firebase DataSnapshot to create an exercise menu with other users in real-time.
- Upload images using Firebase Storage.
- Managed basic synchronous and asynchronous execution with GCD operation.
- Managed users with Firebase Authentication.
